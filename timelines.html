<h2>Timelines</h2>
<p>Here are brief descriptions of several notable Marvel comics timelines/alternate realities</p>

<p>
  <li>Earth-616 (Main Marvel Universe): The primary continuity where most long-running titles and crossover events take place — the “default” Marvel history with the familiar line-up of heroes and villains.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610): A modern, streamlined reimagining of classic characters (launched in the early 2000s) that updates origins, tone, and continuity for new readers.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Age of Apocalypse: An alternate timeline where Professor X is killed, Apocalypse rises to power, and the X-Men fight to survive in a radically changed world.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Days of Future Past: A dystopian future in which mutants are hunted and imprisoned; many stories use time travel to try to prevent that outcome.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Marvel Zombies: A horror-flavored branch where many heroes become flesh-eating zombies, producing bleak, apocalyptic versions of familiar characters.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Marvel 2099: A futuristic line (e.g., Spider-Man 2099) set in the late 21st century with new characters and cyberpunk-flavored takes on Marvel concepts.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>House of M: A reality-altering event (created by Scarlet Witch) that temporarily rewrites reality, producing a “what if” world where mutants dominate and personal histories change.</li>
</p>

  <p>
    <li>MC2 (Marvel Comics 2): A possible near-future timeline focusing on the next generation of heroes (notably Spider-Girl), exploring legacy and family-based storytelling.</li>
  </p>

<p>
  <li>Old Man Logan: A grim, far-future timeline where supervillains have won and an aged Wolverine travels a broken America; it spawned several sequels and inspired other media.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Marvel Noir / Spider-Verse / Other Pocket Universes: Marvel frequently spins off stylized one-shots or mini-universes (noir, manga, dystopian, gender-swapped versions like Spider-Gwen) that retell characters in different genres or eras.</li>
</p>
