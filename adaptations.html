<h2>Adaptations</h2>
<p>Marvel Comics have been adapted across many media—most prominently blockbuster films, television (live-action and animated), video games, and even stage and radio. These adaptations range from fairly faithful retellings of comic arcs to loose reimaginings that update characters, settings, or themes for new audiences and formats.</p>


<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the biggest example: a coordinated series of films and Disney+ shows that rework comic characters and storylines into an interconnected, serialized franchise (Iron Man, Avengers, WandaVision, Loki). Other film adaptations include separate studio takes like the X-Men and Deadpool series (Fox) and various Spider-Man films produced with Sony, each varying in tone and fidelity. On TV, adaptations have included everything from episodic animated series to darker, character-driven live-action shows (Netflix’s Daredevil, Hulu’s Runaways) and network procedurals (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.).</p>


<p>Beyond screen adaptations, Marvel characters appear in popular video games (e.g., Marvel’s Spider-Man, Marvel’s Avengers), toys, and tie-in comics and novels. Adaptations typically balance honoring source material with making changes for pacing, audience, budgets, or serialization—resulting in a wide spectrum of versions that expand Marvel’s cultural reach while sparking ongoing debates about fidelity, interpretation, and creative reinvention.</p>
