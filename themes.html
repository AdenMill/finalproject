<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Here are several important themes commonly found across Marvel comics, with a brief explanation of each</p>

<p>
  <li>Power and responsibility: Characters wrestle with how to use extraordinary abilities ethically (Spider-Man’s “with great power…” is the emblematic example).</li>
</p>


<p>
  <li>Identity and duality: Secret identities, alter egos, and the tension between public persona and private self recur (e.g., Bruce Banner vs. the Hulk).</li>
</p>


<p>
  <li>Alienation and prejudice: X-Men stories frame mutants as marginalized groups, exploring discrimination, fear, and civil-rights–style struggles.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Morality and moral ambiguity: Heroes and villains often operate in gray areas—decisions have costs, and “right” actions aren’t always clear.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Science, technology, and ethics: Tech-driven heroes (Iron Man, tech villains) raise questions about innovation, unintended consequences, and responsibility.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Teamwork, family, and loyalty: Superhero teams (Avengers, X-Men) emphasize collaboration, found-family dynamics, and internal conflicts.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>
    Trauma, loss, and resilience: Many arcs focus on coping with loss, PTSD, and the long-term effects of battles and personal tragedy.
    Corruption and power structures: Stories critique governmental, corporate, and institutional misuse of power (e.g., SHIELD, corporate villains).
  </li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Sacrifice and heroism: Characters repeatedly face choices that demand personal sacrifice for the greater good.</li>
</p>

<p>
  <li>Redemption and complexity of villains: Villains can be sympathetic or seek redemption, showing nuanced motives rather than pure evil.</li>
</p>

<p>These themes overlap and evolve across titles, which is part of what keeps Marvel’s universe rich and resonant.</p>
